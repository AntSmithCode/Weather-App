# Weather App

You will be creating an app to get weather data!

## Requirements

### Part 1
Use a prompt to get the user's zip and display the city and state of that zip code. You can use the `Zippopotamus` API to get this data. 

For example, you would provide `Zippopotamus` with the data `90210` to get data for Beverly Hills. You can see the service provides you with the name of the state and city.

You should use the data on the webpage like this:

### Part 2
Use the `longitude` and `latitude` you get from `Zippopotamus` to get weather data from the `7Timer` API. 

For example, with the data `-118.4` and `34.1` as longitude and latitude respectively, `7Timer` will provide all the weather data for Beverly Hills.

Use the waether information to display the current temperature.

Use all the weather data to generate a 7 day forcast for the given zip code.

Have the browser collect the user's zip code from their location so that they do not have to enter it.
